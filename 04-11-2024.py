# '''The basic difference between the class method vs Static method 
# A class method takes class as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
# A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
# In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods
# that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
# We use @classmethod decorator to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method
# static method:-  static method does not require an instance of the class to be called and cannot access
# or modify the class state. Static methods are used when some functionality relates to the class
# but does not need any instance to perform the work
# To define a static method, you can use the @staticmethod decorator
# class method:- To create a class method, we use the @classmethod decorator or the classmethod()
# function. The method should take cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself.

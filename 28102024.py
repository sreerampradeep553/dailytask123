# OOPS (Object Oriented Programming Service)

# Oops is nothing but to create classes and Objects in real time projects 

# CLASS :- class is nothing but model or blue print
# OBJECT:- object is nothing but it is an real time entity..by using class we can create number of objects

# In real time applications of oops is 
# Banking, gaming,mobile applications etc...


class metroblueprint:
    def display(self,sname):
        print(sname,"metroblueprint")

m=metroblueprint() # here 'm' is object reference variable
m.display(input("enter metro name:"))
m.display(input("enter metroname:"))


## IN OPPS CONCEPT WE HAVE FOUR PILLERS

# --> 1.ENCAPSULATION
# --> 2.ABSTRACTION
# --> 3.POLYMORPHISM
# --> 4.INHERITANCE
